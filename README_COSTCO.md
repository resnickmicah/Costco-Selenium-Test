Hi! Sorry, I know this is cheating because I'm spending longer than 4 hours but I really like having working code (or more specifically, a compiler to make sure I'm not making silly typos) instead of just whiteboard stuff, especially when a language is as syntax-heavy as Java.

I haven't tested this on anything besides my M1 Macbook with Firefox.

I have the test set to run against localhost:8080.

If you just want to see the test code and don't care for running some stranger's code on your local machine (smart!):
